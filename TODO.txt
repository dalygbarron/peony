I had considered needing a seperate entity type but that is not true.
Characters are not animated, at least in their normal selves, and thus using
the sprite name 'aini' is to be expected. the code can detect certain names and
magically give them stuff like proper names when speaking. I also think it
would be cool if they could be given animated blinking but I will look into
that maybe. I don't think that blinking should require a scripted update loop
though btw, it should just be some kind of animation thingy that just plays,
like how in the battles there are animations that are not controlled by the
script.

Implement parsing libgdx texture atlas format. Look at their code, it's
a rat nest but one that is easy to imitate.

Implement sprite list with a custom ListCellRenderer like it talks about here:
